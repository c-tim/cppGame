## subject : Agriculture is the worst error of mankind

## Synopsis :
In a perfect society where agriculture never existed, a group of separatists acquired a time machine to go back in time and share this technology to humans in the Prehistoric era. While doing so, they have to mingle with the population before getting caught by the time police.

The game has two teams : one catcher and one hider (there may be more hiders later).
The hiders have to mimic the non playable humans that are wandering on the map. The catcher has to select the humans he thinks are the humans to win.
The hiders can plant crops secretely to score points, but they can reveal their position.

If the hiders have planted enough crops, they win. Otherwise the catcher wins.
